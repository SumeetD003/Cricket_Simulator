# Advanced_Cricket_Simulator

This is a simple cricket match simulation written in Python using Tkinter for the GUI. It allows you to simulate a 20-overs cricket match between two teams, India and Australia. The match is played in a virtual cricket ground with random outcomes based on the players' abilities and probabilities.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code has been tested on Python 3.8 and above.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `cricket_match_simulation.py` file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `cricket_match_simulation.py` is located.

3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python cricket_match_simulation.py
   ```

4. The GUI window will open, displaying the cricket match simulation.

5. Click the "Start Match" button to begin the match simulation.

6. The match commentary will be displayed in the scrolled text area.

## Gameplay

- The match is between India and Australia, with both teams having 11 players each.

- Each player has different attributes, such as batting, bowling, fielding, running, and experience, which affect their performance.

- The match is simulated for 20 overs, with each over containing 6 balls.

- Players are chosen randomly to bowl each over, and random outcomes are generated for each ball based on probabilities.

- The commentary provides updates on the match, such as runs scored, wickets taken, boundaries hit, dot balls, and more.

- At the end of each inning, the scorecard is displayed, showing the total score and wickets lost.

- After both innings are completed, the winner of the match is determined, or the match can end in a draw.

## About

This cricket match simulation is a fun project to practice Python programming and GUI development with Tkinter. The code includes classes for players, teams, field conditions, umpire, commentary, and the match itself. The GUI is created using Tkinter's `scrolledtext` widget to display the match commentary.

Feel free to modify and improve the code as you like. Enjoy the cricket match simulation!
